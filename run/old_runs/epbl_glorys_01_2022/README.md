This run was initiated in January of 2022 with the goal of simulating 1995-2020 using GLORYS daily resolution data for OBC and IC. JRA55 forcing was used for this simulation. OBC files were generated on Proteus. IC file was generated on Antares. JRA55 files were NOT concatenated for the first edition of this working run. A 1,1 layout was used after we discovered that using anything greater than that did not enhance performance. Tidal files were generated on Antares.
