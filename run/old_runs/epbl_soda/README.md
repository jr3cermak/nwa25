This run was initially created in December of 2021. MOM_input was heavily inspected by Alistair Adcroft and Enrique Curchitser. This was the first edition of using an ePBL scheme as opposed to MEKE scheme with the idea being that ePBL performs better than MEKE at higher resolutions. SODA 5-day OBC and IC files were used. OBC files were generated on Proteus and IC was generated on Antares. JRA55 forcing files were used. Tidal files were generated on Antares.
