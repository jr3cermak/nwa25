This run became successful in March 2022 and is the primary ideology behind nwa25. It uses ERA5 forcing data that has been padded and flooded. It uses GLORYS OBC/IC data. It uses GloFAS river input data. At this point in time, these are some of the highest resolution input datasets available. Please note that this setup requires a special compilation of MOM6 that involves updating the `surface_flux.f90` code ONLY. This update allows MOM6 to handle forcing datasets that have hetereogeneous heights.
